# Hepatitis-C-Disease-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Classified and analyzed Hepatitis C Disease using Machine Learning Algorithms based on factors like Albumin Blood Test, Alkaline phosphates, and etc. 

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for the classification and analysis of Hepatitis C Disease based on various factors such as Albumin Blood Test, Alkaline Phosphatase, Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase, Proteins, and more. The goal is to explore patterns and relationships within the dataset to better understand and potentially predict Hepatitis C cases. To build a convolution ensemble machine learning model to classify the patient test levels into those that diagnosis disease â€“ Hepatitis C or not.

## Features
- **DATA GATHERING:** The data related to the topic was gathered from Kaggle.
-	**DATA ANALYSIS:**  The data was examined to uncover hidden patterns and features that reflect pneumonia from the images in the supplied data set.
-	**DATA VISUALIZATION:** The data was visualized in Tableau to make identifying patterns, trends, and outliers in massive data sets easier.
-	**MODEL EVALUATION:** The model was evaluated to see if it was the best fit for the given problem and data.
-	**TESTING THE MODEL:** The model was put to the test to see if it accurately classified or predicted the outcome.
-	**MODEL COMPARISON:** The examined and predicted results were compared to see how good the model is at predicting the outcome.
- **PERFORMANCE EVALUATION:** Evaluate the performance of the models using relevant metrics and visualizations.
- **DOCUMENTATION:** Provide detailed documentation on the dataset, analysis, and model implementation.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes information on Albumin Blood Test, Alkaline Phosphatase, Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase, Proteins, and other relevant factors. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset used in this repository is a sample or synthetic data for demonstration purposes.

## System Requirements
1. Operating System: Windows 10 or later (64 bit).
2. Disk Space: 1.32 GB (does not include disk space for IDE or tools).
